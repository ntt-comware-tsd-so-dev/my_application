<h1>Agile Link Application Framework</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
The Agile Link SDK is a software development kit created by Ayla Networks to aid in the development
of mobile applications utilizing the Ayla service network.
<p></p>
The goal of the Agile Link SDK is to make it as easy as possible to create iOS and Android
applications that use the Ayla network of connected devices. The app can be easily customized for
look and feel as well as supporting custom devices with minimal effort.

<h2>Architecture Goals</h2>
The primary goal of producing this SDK is to provide a starting point for developers to produce iOS
and Android applications with minimal effort. While the types and capabilities of devices connected
to an Ayla network can vary widely, there are many tasks that need to be performed on all of them. The
AgileLink framework handles the tasks common to all Ayla applications, leaving the developer free to take
care of details specific to the devices and network under development.
<p></p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>
This section outlines steps a developer should take when implementing a new AgileLink application.
<h4>Session Parameters</h4>
The first step towards creating an Agile Link application is to define the {@link com.aylanetworks.agilelink.framework.SessionManager.SessionParameters}.
Session Parameters are used to configure the Ayla library for your application. Modify {@link com.aylanetworks.agilelink.MainActivity#getAppParameters} 
to return a SessionParameters object configured with your application's settings.
<br>
Each application will have its own unique app ID and app secret. These need to be set correctly in the SessionParameters structure.
<br>
Each device that supports wifi setup (creates an access point) will have a string created for the access point's SSID. Make sure that the 
{@link com.aylanetworks.agilelink.framework.SessionManager.SessionParameters#deviceSsidRegex} value will pass through all possible SSIDs that 
your devices may create.
<br>

<h4>Devices</h4>
Once the session parameters have been configured, the next step is to create new Device objects that represent your application's supported devices.
Example Device-derived objects can be found in the {@link com.aylanetworks.agilelink.device.SwitchedDevice} or {@link com.aylanetworks.agilelink.device.AylaEVBDevice} classes.

Your new device class will need to be instantiated whenever a matching device is found. This is done in the
{@link com.aylanetworks.agilelink.framework.DeviceCreator} class. Create a new object derived from
{@link com.aylanetworks.agilelink.framework.DeviceCreator} that creates your own Device-derived objects from 
an AylaDevice object. See {@link com.aylanetworks.agilelink.device.AgileLinkDeviceCreator} for an example of
a DeviceCreator object configured to return specific devices from an AylaDevice object. Once this class has been
created, an instance of it should be assigned to the {@link com.aylanetworks.agilelink.framework.SessionManager.SessionParameters#deviceCreator}
member of the session parameters.

<h4>UI Customization</h4>
The AgileLink UI can be easily customized. Currently the app theme colors, navigation style and list style can be easily
configured within the application.
<br>
The app navigation and list styles are handled by the {@link com.aylanetworks.agilelink.framework.UIConfig} class. The
MainActivity has a {@link com.aylanetworks.agilelink.MainActivity#getUIConfig()} method that should be modified to return the
UIConfig desired for the application.
<br>
Additionally, the colors.xml file contains a set of app theme colors that begin with "app_theme". These colors are referenced 
throughout the application. Modifying the initial 6 colors will change the color scheme of the entire application. Additional
customization can be achieved through modifying the remaining colors individually. Those colors default to references to one of 
the 6 app_theme colors.

<h3>Useful Links</h3>
<ul>
    <li>{@link com.aylanetworks.agilelink.framework.SessionManager} handles sign in / sign out and creates the DeviceManager</li>
    <li>{@link com.aylanetworks.agilelink.framework.DeviceManager} polls the list of devices and the status of each device
    <li>{@link com.aylanetworks.agilelink.framework.ContactManager} takes care of contacts for notifications</li>
    <li>{@link com.aylanetworks.agilelink.framework.MenuHandler} provides a centralized location for handling menu events</li>
</ul>
