<h1>Agile Link Application Framework</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
The Agile Link SDK is a software development kit created by Ayla Networks to aid in the development
of mobile applications utilizing the Ayla service network.
<p></p>
The goal of the Agile Link SDK is to make it as easy as possible to create iOS and Android
applications that use the Ayla network of connected devices. The app can be easily customized for
look and feel as well as supporting custom devices with minimal effort.

<h2>Architecture Goals</h2>
The primary goal of producing this SDK is to provide a starting point for developers to produce iOS
and Android applications with minimal effort. While the types and capabilities of devices connected
to an Ayla network can vary widely, there are many tasks that need to be performed on all of them. The
AgileLink framework handles the tasks common to all Ayla applications, leaving the developer free to take
care of details specific to the devices and network under development.

<h2>Framework Components</h2>
The Agile Link Framework consists of a set of classes designed to take care of connecting to and interacting
with the Ayla Cloud Service and the devices residing on it. Application developers can use these classes, found
in the {@link com.aylanetworks.agilelink.framework} package, to take care of standard tasks in the Ayla system.
<br>
The framework also consists of a set of user interface elements that can be used, customized or extended to meet
the needs of the application under development. The UI elements in Agile Link support a degree of customization, and
leverage abstraction of Device components to allow device-specific customizations. The UI portion of the Agile Link 
application can be found in the {@link com.aylanetworks.agilelink.fragments} package.
<br><br>
Code residing within the {@link com.aylanetworks.agilelink.framework} package generally should not be modified. It was 
designed to work with a wide range of devices with various needs. Application customization should be done via the 
Device object classes, which can return custom Fragments for details via {@link com.aylanetworks.agilelink.framework.Device#getDetailsFragment},
custom CardViews when displayed in a RecyclerView as a list or grid item via {@link com.aylanetworks.agilelink.framework.Device#bindViewHolder},
{@link com.aylanetworks.agilelink.framework.Device#getItemViewType} and {@link com.aylanetworks.agilelink.framework.DeviceCreator#viewHolderForViewType}. Additional UI customization can be performed via updating the {@link com.aylanetworks.agilelink.framework.UIConfig} parameters returned from
{@link com.aylanetworks.agilelink.MainActivity#getUIConfig} or changing the app_theme colors in colors.xml.
<br><br>
While the fragment classes found in {@link com.aylanetworks.agilelink.fragments} are designed to work well with customized Device objects, 
further customization may be desired. Implementers may use the default UI screens provided in this package, or may provide custom
interfaces if desired.

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
This section outlines steps a developer should take when implementing a new AgileLink application. The basic steps 
toward getting an Agile Link application running quickly are:
<br>
<ul>
    <li>Modify the {@link com.aylanetworks.agilelink.framework.SessionManager.SessionParameters} object created in 
        {@link com.aylanetworks.agilelink.MainActivity#getAppParameters()} with your application's app ID, app secret
        and any other settings you would like your app to use.</li>
    <li>Create classes derived from {@link com.aylanetworks.agilelink.framework.Device} for each hardware device you
        wish to support. These classes can provide a custom UI for list views, detail fragments and other elements, or
        can default to using the generic behavior provided by the {@link com.aylanetworks.agilelink.framework.Device}
        class.</li>
    <li>Create a {@link com.aylanetworks.agilelink.framework.DeviceCreator}-derived class that creates your Device-based
        objects from an AylaDevice from the cloud service. This class will examine each AylaDevice returned for the account
        and create the appropriate Device-derived object for the particular device. Generally devices are identified by the
        oemModel field of the AylaDevice object. See {@link com.aylanetworks.agilelink.device.AgileLinkDeviceCreator} for an
        example of a DeviceCreator implementation.</li>
    <li>Create an instance of your DeviceCreator class and assign it to the {@link com.aylanetworks.agilelink.framework.SessionManager.SessionParameters#deviceCreator} member of the SessionParameters.</li>
</ul>

The Agile Link framework should take care of the rest.

<h3>Session Parameters</h3>
The first step towards creating an Agile Link application is to define the {@link com.aylanetworks.agilelink.framework.SessionManager.SessionParameters}.
Session Parameters are used to configure the Ayla library for your application. Modify {@link com.aylanetworks.agilelink.MainActivity#getAppParameters} 
to return a SessionParameters object configured with your application's settings.
<br>
Each application will have its own unique app ID and app secret. These need to be set correctly in the SessionParameters structure.
<br>
Each device that supports wifi setup (creates an access point) will have a string created for the access point's SSID. Make sure that the 
{@link com.aylanetworks.agilelink.framework.SessionManager.SessionParameters#deviceSsidRegex} value will pass through all possible SSIDs that 
your devices may create.
<br>

<h3>Devices</h3>
Once the session parameters have been configured, the next step is to create new Device objects that represent your application's supported devices.
Example Device-derived objects can be found in the {@link com.aylanetworks.agilelink.device.SwitchedDevice} or {@link com.aylanetworks.agilelink.device.AylaEVBDevice} classes.
<br><br>
Device classes can override these methods to provide additional functionality:
<ul>
    <li>{@link com.aylanetworks.agilelink.framework.Device#deviceTypeName()} should be overridden to return a friendly name for the device,
        such as &quot;Smart Plug&quot; or &quot;Wall Switch&quot;. This name is presented to the user in a drop-down list when the user
        navigates to the Add Device screen, and when selected, chooses the appropriate registration type for the device.</li>
    <li>{@link com.aylanetworks.agilelink.framework.Device#registrationType()} should be overridden to return the appropriate registration type
        for the device.</li>
    <li>{@link com.aylanetworks.agilelink.framework.Device#getPropertyNames()} should be overridden to return an array of property names
        that should be regularly polled. The DeviceManager will poll these properties to determine if the state of the device has changed.
        If polling properties is not the appropriate way to update the device status, the class may instead override
        {@link com.aylanetworks.agilelink.framework.Device#updateStatus}, which will be called each poll interval. This method is responsible
        for performing whatever operations are necessary to update the status of the device.</li>f
    <li>{@link com.aylanetworks.agilelink.framework.Device#getSchedulablePropertyNames} and {@link com.aylanetworks.agilelink.framework.Device#getNotifiablePropertyNames} should return arrays of property names that can be used in schedules or property notifications.
    <li>{@link com.aylanetworks.agilelink.framework.Device#friendlyNameForPropertyName} should be overridden to return a friendly, localized
        string for a given property. This is used when presenting properties to the user, such as in a schedule or notification screen.</li>
    <li>{@link com.aylanetworks.agilelink.framework.Device#getDeviceDrawable} should be overridden to return a drawable representing the device.</li>
    <li>{@link com.aylanetworks.agilelink.framework.Device#getItemViewType()} and {@link com.aylanetworks.agilelink.framework.Device#bindViewHolder}
        can be modified along with {@link com.aylanetworks.agilelink.framework.DeviceCreator#viewHolderForViewType} to create custom views for 
        devices when shown in list or grid views.</li>
    <li>{@link com.aylanetworks.agilelink.framework.Device#getDetailsFragment()} may be overridden to return a custom fragment showing details about
        the device.</li>
</ul>


Your new device class will need to be instantiated whenever a matching device is found. This is done in the
{@link com.aylanetworks.agilelink.framework.DeviceCreator} class. Create a new object derived from
{@link com.aylanetworks.agilelink.framework.DeviceCreator} that creates your own Device-derived objects from 
an AylaDevice object. See {@link com.aylanetworks.agilelink.device.AgileLinkDeviceCreator} for an example of
a DeviceCreator object configured to return specific devices from an AylaDevice object. Once this class has been
created, an instance of it should be assigned to the {@link com.aylanetworks.agilelink.framework.SessionManager.SessionParameters#deviceCreator}
member of the session parameters.
<br><br>
In order for your device to appear in the drop-down list when adding a new device, make sure the device class is returned from
{@link com.aylanetworks.agilelink.framework.DeviceCreator#getSupportedDeviceClasses}. The devices returned from this method
are used to populate the list of devices available to register.

<h3>UI Customization</h3>
The AgileLink UI can be easily customized. Currently the app theme colors, navigation style and list style can be easily
configured within the application.
<br>
The app navigation and list styles are handled by the {@link com.aylanetworks.agilelink.framework.UIConfig} class. The
MainActivity has a {@link com.aylanetworks.agilelink.MainActivity#getUIConfig()} method that should be modified to return the
UIConfig desired for the application.
<br>
Additionally, the colors.xml file contains a set of app theme colors that begin with "app_theme". These colors are referenced 
throughout the application. Modifying the initial 6 colors will change the color scheme of the entire application. Additional
customization can be achieved through modifying the remaining colors individually. Those colors default to references to one of 
the 6 app_theme colors.

<h4>UI Task Table</h4>
<table border="1" style="width:80%">
    <tr><th>I want to</th><th>Here&apos;s how:</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Change the application font</td><td>Change the <i>fontFamily</i> field in <i>config.xml</i></td></tr>
    <tr><td>Change the way the list of devices is presented</td><td>Update the listStyle of UIConfig in MainActivity.java</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Set an image for my new device</td><td>Override {@link com.aylanetworks.agilelink.framework.Device#getDeviceDrawable} in your new device class</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Use swipe navigation instead of a pager</td><td>Update the navStyle of UIConfig in MainActivity.java</td></tr>
</table>

<h2>Application Flow</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Application is launched</li>
    <li>{If the user has previously logged in, the MainActivity will sign in the user via a call to {@link com.aylanetworks.agilelink.framework.SessionManager#startSession}. Otherwise, the {@link com.aylanetworks.agilelink.SignInActivity} is launched presenting the sign-in UI to the user.</li>
    <li>The {@link com.aylanetworks.agilelink.MainActivity}, who has registered with the SessionManager as a SessionListener, is notified when sign-in 
        completes and displays the list of devices. The {@link com.aylanetworks.agilelink.framework.DeviceManager} is created by the SessionManager and 
        fetches the list of devices from the server. The {@link com.aylanetworks.agilelink.fragments.AllDevicesFragment} registers as a 
        {@link com.aylanetworks.agilelink.framework.DeviceManager.DeviceListListener}, and receives notificaitons whenever the list of devices changes.</li>
    <li>The {@link com.aylanetworks.agilelink.framework.DeviceManager} provides notifications to any registered listener for changes to the device status
        via the {@link com.aylanetworks.agilelink.framework.Device.DeviceStatusListener} interface. Various fragments throughout the application register
        themselves as listeners to receive updates whenever the device status changes.</li>
    <li>The {@link com.aylanetworks.agilelink.framework.DeviceManager} polls the status of each device by calling its {@link com.aylanetworks.agilelink.framework.Device.updateStatus} method, which by default fetches the set of properties returned from {@link com.aylanetworks.agilelink.framework.Device#getPropertyNames} and comparing an updated device with the original device via {@link com.aylanetworks.agilelink.framework.Device#isDeviceChanged}.</li>
    <li>Menu navigation is generally handled via the static {@link com.aylanetworks.agilelink.framework.MenuHandler} class, which can be tailored to handle 
        additional menu items that may be required by the application.</li>
</ul>
