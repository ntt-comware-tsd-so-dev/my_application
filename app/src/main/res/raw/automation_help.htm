    <h2>Device Automations</h2>
    Automations can be used to control your devices based on your location. Geofences and Beacons
    can be set up to perform actions when you approach or leave a specified location. <p>
    A Geofence uses your mobile device&#39;s GPS to determine when you have entered or left a
    certain area on the map.<p>
    Beacons use your mobile device&#39;s Bluetooth radio to determine how close you
    are to a particular beacon.<p>
    <p>
    Actions in AMAP consist of a device, a property and a value. When the action is executed,
    the selected property of the selected device will be set to the provided value.<p>
    Automations represent the pairing of a Geofence or Beacon event with an Action, allowing devices
    to be manipulated based on your location. <p>

    <h2>Events</h2>
    An Event is something that happens that causes Actions to be taken. Currently, AMAP supports
    two types of events: <i>Geofences</i> and <i>Beacons</i>. Both events are based on the physical
    location of the mobile device. Geofences use the mobile device&#39;s GPS location to determine
    position, while Beacons use the physical proximity to a Beacon as a source of the event.
    <h3>Geofences</h3>
    A Geofence is basically a radius around a point on the map. Events can be triggered if the
    mobile device enters or leaves the geofence area (e.g. comes within or leaves the circle defined
    by the point and radius). AMAP supports up to 5 simultaneous geofences. To create a geofence:<p>
    <ol>
        <li>In the main menu, select <i>Geofence Locations</i></li>
        <li>Tap the &#39;+&#39; button to create a new Geofence</li>
        <li>A map will be presented to you with a pin representing the location of your geofence and
            a circle around it representing the radius</li>
        <li>Scroll the map around to change the center location of the geofence</li>
        <li>Slide the slider below the map to change the radius of the geofence</li>
        <li>When the location and radius are correct, tap the edit box to name your geofence and hit
            <i>Save</i></li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Beacons</h3>
    A Beacon is similar to a Geofence in that it is used to help determine the proximity of the
    mobile device, but the location and radius of a Beacon is based on the physical location of the
    Beacon and its strength. In order to use a Beacon with AMAP, a BLE beacon must be purchased that
    supports either the iBeacon or Eddystone beacon standards. AMAP supports up to 5 simultaneous
    Beacons. To set up a Beacon within AMAP:<p>
    <ol>
        <li>In the main menu, select <i>Beacons</i></li>
        <li>Tap the &#39;+&#39; button to add a new beacon</li>
        <li>Once the app scans for and discovers your beacon, select it and choose a name for it</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Actions</h2>
    Actions are used to control your devices when an event happens. An action consists of a device,
    a property and a value. When the action is run, the property of the device is set to the
    specified value. This can be used to turn on or off devices, set light levels of dimmable bulbs,
    or control your devices in just about any way.<p>
    To create an Action:
    <ol>
        <li>In the main menu, select <i>Device Actions</i></li>
        <li>Here you will see a list of your registered devices. Find the device you wish to control,
            and tap the &#39;+&#39; button</li>
        <li>Choose a name for your action and enter it in the Action Name field</li>
        <li>From the drop-down list, select the property you wish to modify with this action</li>
        <li>Once the property has been selected, enter the value the Action should set the property
            to in the edit field</li>
        <li>Tap <i>Save</i> to save your action. The action may now be used in automations.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Automations</h2>
    Automations is where everything is tied together. An Automation ties an Event (Geofence or Beacon)
    to an Action. AMAP supports up to 10 simultaneous Automations.<p>
    To create a new Automation, first make sure you have at least one Event and one Action already
    defined, and then:<p>
    <ol>
        <li>From the main menu, select <i>Automations</i></li>
        <li>Tap the &#39;+&#39; button to create a new Automation</li>
        <li>Choose a name for your automation and enter it into the Automation Name field</li>
        <li>Select either <i>Geofence Locations</i> or <i>Beacons</i>, depending on which trigger
            you would like to use</li>
        <li>From the drop-down list, choose the Geofence Location or Beacon you wish to use as the
            event source</li>
        <li>Next to <i>Perform these actions</i>, tap the &#39;+&#39; button</li>
        <li>From the list of defined actions, check the boxes next to the actions you would like
            performed in response to this event. Tap <i>Done</i> when finished.</li>
        <li>Tap <i>Done</i> to create your automation</li>
    </ol>
    Your new automation will now appear in the list of automations. The automation may be enabled or
    disabled from this screen by sliding the switch.
